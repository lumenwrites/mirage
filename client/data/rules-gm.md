### Combat
There are 3 distances. If the monster is **In Reach** of the player, that means they can hit it with a melee weapon. If the monster is **In Range**, then the player can hit it with a ranged weapon or a spell, or run up to it during their turn. If the enemy is **Too Far** then the player needs to move closer.

To prepare an enemy encounter, pick which spells the enemy will be able to cast, which items they carry, and how much Health and Energy they have. Or just use one of the premade NPCs.

After the combat, give each player one of the items the defeated enemies had on them (randomly).


### Friendly NPCs
Decide which items the NPC has in their inventory, in case the players will want to trade with them. Think about what kind of abilities they could teach the players. If they have a quest to give, decide on the quest reward.

### Enemy NPCs
Small monsters have 6HP, 6EP, deal 2DMG per attack. Big ones have 10HP, 10EP, deal 4DMG. Tweak as needed. For people - use premade character sheets, or create your own. Decide on HP, EP, and pick Abilities, Spells, Magic Items, and Weapons for them.

### Awarding Experience
Award experience points to the players for completing quests, overcoming difficult challenges, out-of-the-box thinking, great roleplaying moments, and finding clever non-combat resolutions.

After the players complete a quest or overcome a big challenge, ask players to vote on their favorite character moment, idea, or a joke, and grant the author of the best one an extra experience point.

### Leveling Up
When your party completes a major challenge or a big part of a quest, tell them they level up. All characters in the party level up at the same time.

Use leveling up and awarding experience points to control how powerful the party is. Do it slower for longer campaigns, and faster if you want characters to gain powers quicker.

### One-shots

When running a one-shot game, invite characters within the appropriate range of levels to keep the party balanced.

Characters maintain their levels between separate one-shot games. A player can play with some other GM, level up, and join your game as a higher level character.

### Deciding if the player succeeds at an action
Use your own judgment and common sense to decide whether the player's action is successful. If you were reading a novel, and this character had tried to do what the player wants to attempt, would you believe that they succeed?

Follow the rule of cool. The more awesome, creative, or funny the player’s idea is, the more likely it is to work.

Don’t be afraid to add difficulties. When it serves the story, adding tension, drama, and challenges is good. Instead of telling the player that they fail, consider adding drawbacks or unintended negative consequences (“You have successfully killed the guard, but someone has seen it and is now running to raise the alarm.”)

If you’re still unsure whether or not the player should succeed at what they’re trying to do, use this formula:

1. Mentally rank the player’s idea from 1 to 5 (from stupid to brilliant), rank their roleplaying from 1 to 5 (from poor to excellent), add these numbers together. Append 5 to the result if the player has a relevant ability.
2. Mentally rank the difficulty of the challenge the player is facing from 1 to 10.
3. If the first number is higher, the player succeeds, otherwise they fail.

### Rule Zero
All these rules are only a guideline, they exist to help you have fun and tell a cool story. If a rule stands in the way of playing the game you enjoy - ignore it or change it. You are free to override any of the rules, to simplify or extend this system.

If there’s any confusion about the rules - don’t waste time arguing about them or looking things up. Make the decision that makes the most sense to you and go with it
