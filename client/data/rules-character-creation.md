To create your character you will need to fill in your character sheet. Character sheet will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, and inventory, and the description of your character’s appearance, personality, goals, and backstory - everything you need for roleplaying.

Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. [Just select one from the dropdown], come up with your character concept and fill in your character description.

Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character. [Start witth an empty character sheet] and add:

- Up to 5 first level abilities and spells
- One magic item
- Up to 4 items in your equipment (weapons, potions, adventuring grear).
