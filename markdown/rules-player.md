### Health
Your initial max health is 10 hit-points. You lose points when you get hurt. Recover points by drinking a potion, using a spell, or taking a rest.

**Short rest** (1 hour in a safe environment) recovers 4 points.

**Long rest** (8 hours in a safe environment) restores you to full health.

### Energy Points (EP)
Your initial max energy is 5 points. Spend them to cast spells, use abilities or items.

To cast a spell (or use an ability), spend the amount of points equal to it's level (casting a 3rd Level Spell costs 3 Energy points).

Recover them by drinking a potion or taking a rest (same as health).

You can also recover them when you indulge in your character's flaw or succumb to their weakness in a way that makes you vulnerable, introduces a complication, sacrifices your relationships, or otherwise puts you at a risk/disadvantage. For example: get angry, act reckless, get caught lying, forget something important, surrender, run away, act lazy, get high at the worst possible moment, trigger the memory of a past trauma, antagonize an NPC, threaten someone too powerful, etc. Depending on the severity of the complication it causes, GM will award you  1-10 EP.


### Experience (XP)
Spend points to learn spells and abilities. To learn a spell or an ability, spend the amount of points equal to it's level (learning a 3rd Level Ability costs 3 Experience points).

Spend 2 points to increase your max Health or Energy by 1 point.

Gain XP as a reward for overcoming challenges, completing quests, and awesome roleplay moments.

### Levels (LVL)

Characters start at level 1 (novice) and can grow up to level 10 (godlike). Characters level up when they complete major quests.

Your character can learn spells/abilities according to their level (3rd level character can learn 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells).

### Abilities
Extraordinary abilities or specific skills your character has. For example, being very strong, knowing how to pick locks, or being great at seduction.


Without the ability, your character is as good at doing things as an average person. You can assume that you will succeed if you try to do something that any regular person is capable of. But if you want to attempt doing something really difficult or risky, the GM can say that it would require a relevant ability (you would need a   “Strongman” ability to lift a super heavy rock, “a Diplomat” to talk the king out of starting a war).

### Inventory
You can carry and use up to 10 Items. Mundane and tiny items don’t count (a note, a pen, regular clothes). Ammo doesn’t count.

During the short rest, you can unequip items and stash them somewhere (at your house, on a horse, etc). Stashed items can’t be used until re-equipped.


### Trading
There’s no gold. There’s no need to micromanage paying for meals, a simple room in an inn, or buying mundane items (arrows, ink).


You can trade items in your inventory with friendly NPCs and other players. Items don’t have a predetermined price. It all depends on how much the NPC likes you, and how much they want what you have to offer in exchange. Negotiate and bargain to get a better deal.

Give a valuable item to an NPC in exchange for teaching you a skill. Or offer to do some work for them.

### Combat
During the combat, players take turns to act. When all the players have taken their turn, the GM gets a round of turns for all the NPCs they control. 

During your turn, your character can move around and do one thing (for example, cast a spell). If you have a shield spell, or a dodge skill, or something else that can help you evade the damage, you can cast it when you're attacked. 


After the combat, each player can take 1 random item that belonged to an enemy.

If you run out of Health, you pass out. If someone hits you when you’re passed out, you die and turn into a ghost. You can haunt your fellow players until they find a resurrection scroll, or make a new character
