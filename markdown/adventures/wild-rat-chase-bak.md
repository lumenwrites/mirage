# Scenes

## Intro

You have been sailing for several weeks now, your course is Cypress, the capital of Anglecynn, the biggest city on the whole continent. At this point you’re so tired of the ocean, you sincerely hope to never see a drop of water again in your life. Luckily, today is supposed to be the last day of your travels, you’re about to arrive.

You're sitting at an old grimy table, on a middle deck of a ship, waiting for the miserable journey to end.  A piraty-looking sailor, with eyepatches on both of his eyes, comes up to you, pours himself a mug full of rum, and drinks it down in one gulp, and asks “: “What brings you to Cypress, mateys? And what do you look like? I'm really out of the loop here.” He points, sadly, at his eyepatches.

(It’s time to introduce your characters)


## Arriving into the Port

As your conversation continues, suddenly you hear the voice from the upper deck “Land! We've made it! Thank the gods!” You weren't sure you would, successfully sailing to your destination in the medieval times is always a coin toss.

You hear many excited voices and commotion from the upper deck.


The sailor stands up from the table "Alright, mateys, I'll go up, take a loo..." he cuts himself off, "Smell some fresh air, I guess" he finishes sadly. "Follow me if you wish to see the City in all of its glory"

You walk up to the top deck of the ship, look ahead, and behold the glorious city of Cypress. A huge castle with white walls at the top of the cliff, and the city surrounding it. The city looks quite a bit scruffier than the castle, but it’s the most impressive one you’ve seen so far. Soon enough, your ship will arrive and dock in the bay.

You arrive at the port, the ship docks, and you finally feel the firm ground underneath your feet. You see many sailors running down the gangway onto the bustling boardwalk. Some of them drop on their knees, crying, kissing the earth. It’s been a long time for these dudes.

Many ships are in this port, people are walking around, delivering cargo to and from the ships, selling their wares.
