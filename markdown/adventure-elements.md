### Quest Idea (Problem/Goal)
Stories are about problem solving. The idea for your adventure is the main problem your players will be trying to solve throughout the game, the main goal they will need to pursue. Ideally, it will have the following properties:

- **Exciting Premise**  
The problem your characters are facing should be promising to take them on a cool journey, to put them in entertaining, thrilling, unlikely, fantastical situations. The process of trying to solve the problem should be compelling, fun to be a part of.

- **High Stakes**  
Your players and their characters need to have a meaningful reason to care about solving the problem. It should be very valuable or important, to them personally or to the world they live in.

- **Challenging**  
Easy things are boring to do. There should be a reason why the problem wasn’t solved before, why it takes a group of heroes to tackle it. Solving the problem should push the characters to their limits, demand inventiveness and creativity.

### Challenges and Obstacles
As your players struggle to achieve their main goal, they will encounter obstacles, which will be interesting and rewarding to overcome. Challenges should be exciting, difficult, and necessary to overcome in order to solve the problem. Pick 3 challenges, gradually escalating the difficulty, stakes, importance, commitment, and threats. The last challenge is the most difficult and climactic of all, it will determine whether the heroes succeed or fail at their mission.

### Characters
Players will encounter several types of characters on their adventures:

- **The Villain and their Henchmen**  
The primary antagonist of the story (and the people allied with them) will likely be the main cause of difficulties on the player’s path, because their goals are the opposite from the player’s goals.

- **Monsters**  
The creatures players encounter on their path will be an extra source of obstacles. 

- **Friendly/Neutral NPCs**  
They can introduce the players to the quest, help them, provide valuable information or exposition, create roleplaying opportunities. They can also trade with players and teach them abilities.

You will need to know the NPC’s appearance, personality, goals, relationships with the players, and possibly their backstory. Consider building them based on characters from popular fiction.

If the character is likely to fight players, trade with them, or be otherwise important to the story, create the character sheet and description for them.


### World
You will need to create an exciting and fascinating world for the players to play in, cool places for them to visit and explore. You will need to know how the world looks visually, what are its social/cultural norms, what does daily life look like.

Create the location where players will start their journey, key points of interest in the nearby region, settings for the most important scenes, and an awesome set piece for the climax of the story.
