You don’t need to plan out everything before you start playing. Don’t meticulously craft a complete storyline, instead - prepare the most important elements, and improvise the rest on the fly.

### What will be the players’ Problem/Goal?
Resolving it will be the single most important event that will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the final battle revolves around.
What is exciting about it, why is it important, what makes it difficult?

### What challenges will the players encounter?
What 3-5 obstacles will they need to overcome to achieve their goal?

### How will they encounter the problem?
What will be the first scene that draws players into action, and gives them the first set of tasks to accomplish?

An NPC may beg them for help or give them a job, they may hear about a valuable item they can acquire, a mystery they need to unravel, a cool location to visit, a villain being up to no good, etc.


### What are the most important NPCs up to?
Who they are, what do they want, how do they feel about the players, where they are, what are they doing, what is their connection to the story? 

What are the 3 steps to the antagonist’s plan, and how will the players know he’s making progress?

### Where does the adventure begin?
Introduce the scene. Describe where the players are and what’s going on around them.

### To what areas might your adventure lead?
Design 3-5 locations nearby. For each, write a short description, and list a few notable, important, dangerous, or useful things the players will find there. What makes this place awesome? List a couple of environmental or social things that make this location unique and interesting.

### What scenes might be important?
Make a short list of scenes you expect to see during the adventure. Where will the scene take place? Which NPCs will the players interact with and what will they say? What obstacle will players need to overcome?

### What do players need to know about the story?
List 5-10 important pieces of information about the story, the secrets/clues the players will discover during their adventure. Don’t decide on how they will discover them, you will use them when the opportunity presents itself. Players may see it, overhear it, find it in the library, interrogate it out of an enemy, etc.


### Who will they fight or with?
Create the enemy NPCs. Use the premade character sheets or make your own. 

### Which items will the players acquire?
Prepare the items NPCs will have in their inventory for trading, and the treasure the players may find or receive as a reward for the quest.
