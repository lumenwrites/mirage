To create your character you will need to fill in your [character sheet](/character-sheet). It will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, and inventory, and the description of your character’s appearance, personality, goals, and backstory - everything you need for roleplaying.

Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the character sheet templates. When you hover ower the "Create" button, you'll see a list of character archetypes (Wizard, Warrior, etc), pick one that you like best. Then all you need is to come up with your character idea (name, appearance, personality, etc), and fill in your character description.

Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character. Create a blank character sheet and add:

- Up to 5 first level abilities and spells.
- One 1st level magic item or a potion.
- Up to 4 items in your equipment (weapons, adventuring grear).

If you’re not sure what kind of character to create - use your favorite character from a book or a movie. If you want to make it more original - combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman).
