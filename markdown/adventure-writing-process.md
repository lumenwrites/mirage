# Adventure Writing Process (steps to writing your first adventure)
Hey, everyone! My [Adventure Template post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/hdrq9w/adventure_template_a_list_of_the_most_important/) really took off, many people found it useful. So now I want to share with you my notes on the actual process of writing adventures, filling in the template in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming, can be done reasonably quickly, and will help to bypass all the confusion and writer's blocks.

This is work in progress, if you have any questions, feedback, or advice on how to improve/simplify the process - please share, it would be extremely helpful!

#  Writing Process
## Clear Attainable Goals 
The process of creating an adventure is broken down into 10 steps (see them at the end of the post). These steps give you clear, attainable goals. Their purpose is to take you from "I'm stuck, I don't know what to write about" to "Today I need to find answers to these specific questions". This removes the confusion and ambiguity about what to do next, which is the main cause of the "writer's block".

Go through the steps in order. Take the first task, complete it, move on to the next. Omce you're done, you will have a complete adventure.

## Deadlines vs Perfectionism
Setting deadlines will help you make consistent progress and avoid perfectionism. 

Do the best you can within the timeframe that you have. Answer questions, make creative choices, commit to them, and move on to the next task.

Don't try to complete each task perfectly, that slows you down and gets you stuck. Instead of trying to come up with the best answers right away - aim for "good enough", move on, and work with what you've got. It will be much easier to tweak and improve things after you have completed the first draft.

Aim to complete one step per day. Depending on your skill level and the scope of the adventure, you can change your deadline to one step per hour or one step per 2 days. You can always go faster, but don't go slower. It's much better to go through the process faster, and gain skill by completing multiple adventures than to get stuck trying to perfect a single one.

## Asking/Answering Questions
You complete the steps by asking and answering questions. 

- The step gives you a goal to accomplish (such as "Brainstorm adventure ideas and pick one." or "Design NPCs."). 
- Open [Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7bOixB-1tN7U3lEi47L-NDA91CibDJ0VTgrbKO2nlQ/) and use it to compile a list of 3-5 questions for today (such as "Who are the most important NPCs?" or "What is my Antagonist's appearance/personality/goal?")
- For each question, list 3-5 possible answers, pick your favorite, and move on to the next question.

## Simplest Playable Adventure
Startup founders and programmers use an idea of Minimum Viable Product - they create a list of features they need to build in order to release the simplest usable version of their app, that they can iterate on and improve later. It helps them turn an overwhelming task into something manageable. 

Use the list of question the same way, your main goal is to figure out what you need to create the Simplest Playable Adventure. Later you will make a list of the most important things you want to improve, that way your effort is spent on doing things that add the most value to your adventure, and not on confusing/unimportant distractions.

You can even use an app like [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) to keep track of all the things you need to figure out, it will help you to stay on track and move forward step by step.

## Blank Page vs Lego Blocks
One more way to simplify writing process is to use writing tropes instead of trying to come up with everything from scratch. In other words - steal and adapt ideas from everything you can. If you're struggling with a question (a story idea, a character, a location, etc) -  don't hesitate to take one from a book or a movie. You can use it as a placeholder to tweak and replace later, you can combine multiple ideas to make something new, or you can use one with minimal changes. That way, creating an adventure feels like building it out of lego blocks, instead of staring at the blank page.

You can even just take a TV episode or a published adventure, mine it for ideas and answers, and use this process to adapt it to your game. 

Making existing ideas more original:
- Simplify or expand it.
- Combine multiple ideas. Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow. Hogwarts + Xavier College for Superheroes. Jurassic Park + Honey I Shrunk The Kids = Anatomy Park.
- Change the genre from Sci Fi to Fantasy or from Horror to Comedy.  Fantasy Futurama episode, serious Gravity Falls episode, lighthearted Game of Thrones.
- Reverse one of the important aspects of the idea - tell the story from the perspective of the antagonist, where evil guys are good and vice versa. Switch the character's gender or an important personality trait. Female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman.

- Lists of TV episodes on Wikipedia.

# Steps
See [Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7bOixB-1tN7U3lEi47L-NDA91CibDJ0VTgrbKO2nlQ/) for more details.

Bainstorm/Browse ideas, list 3-5, pick one.
Write one-paragraph summary of what the adventure is about.
2. Design Obstacles/Challenges.
List 5-10 problems/complications the players will encounter, pick 3-5.
Write short descriptions of each one - how do the players encounter it, what are the possible solutions.
3. Design NPCs.
Antagonists. Villain, 3-5 Minions/Monsters. 
Quest Giver, 3-5 Friendly/Neutral NPCs.
Write short 1-paragraph descriptions for each.
4. Locations and Worldbuilding.

8. Playtest Play by Post.
Once the first draft is complete - create a Discord server, find 2-3 people on /r/lfg to help you playtest the adventure. Run the game in Discord text chat, play by post (that way you have more time to think), improvise everything that's missing as you go, go along with what players suggest, let them add to the story. After the game ask players for feedback. Collect the new ideas you've discovered, list the issues you've encountered, and make improvements.
9. Voice Chat Game.
Play the game over the voice chat (or in person).
10. Clean up the notes and publish adventure.
Combine and edit all your notes in and everything you wrote in play-by-post game to create a neat and clean adventure. Homebrewery.
