# Big list of Challenges for your Adventure

I have compiled a big list of challenges (Problems/Goals/Complications) your players can encounter during the adventure. They are split into categories - Action/Adventure, Social/Intrigue, Mystery/Investigation, Stealth/Heist, and Complications.

This list is also available as a "[Story Generator App](https://playmirage.io/prompts)".

Use [Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7bOixB-1tN7U3lEi47L-NDA91CibDJ0VTgrbKO2nlQ/) to develop these prompts into a complete adventure.

Please contribute to this project - send me your challenge ideas! Leave a comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/hmso63/a_big_list_of_challenges/), email them to me at **lumen@playmirage.io**, or tweet at [@lumenwrites](https://twitter.com/lumenwrites).

# Complications

- Difficult choice. Choose lesser of two evils, choose which people to rescue. Requiring personal sacrifice, risk, compromise. 
- Opportunities that come with a difficulty, cost or have negative consequences.
- Resolve moral dilemma (the creature is dangerous but doesn't deserve to die, you're working for a bad guy, both sides of the conflict have valid points, completing a quest will harm people/environment).

- Do it with incomplete information.
- Do it with limited resources or without preparation.
- Do it without access to powers you're used to having (while sick/injured/debilitated, in an area where magic is outlawed/disabled, having lost your equipment).

- You can't trust anyone.
- Doing it is illegal, or against authorities best interests, or is threatening a powerful group.

- Do it while working together with antagonist or someone else you don't like. 

- The side you're working for turns out to be evil.
- The villain is someone you know/like/respect.
- The villain is a respected public figure, celebrity, is liked by people or has authority over you.

# Using Challenges to create Adventures
- These challenges can be used as **sub-goals** the players will need to achieve on the path to their main goal, as obstacles they need to overcome to get what they want.
- Most of them can also be used as the **primary goal**, an idea for the whole adventure (just make the stakes higher, make it important/interesting/exciting to accomplish, make it more difficult, add sub-goals and obstacles players need to get through to achieve it).
- Challenges can be **mixed and matched**. In one adventure, challenge A can be the big primary goal, and challenge B can be a step towards accomplishing this big goal. In another adventure, it can be the other way around. In one adventure, the players need to obtain an item (a powerful weapon) to slay a monster, in another, they need to slay a monster to get their hands on the valuable item. In one adventure they need to rescue someone who has a clue to the mystery, in another they need to solve a mystery to be able to rescue someone.
- **Use multiple challenges together** to add more depth, make the adventure more difficult/interesting, get players to fight on several fronts. **Combine challenges** to make them complications for each other, or **use conflicting challenges** that are incompatible with each other to create difficult choices. Players need to protect a person while also being on the run from the law, they need to spy on someone while traveling through the dangerous environment, they need to fight for political power while pretending to be someone they're not, they need to slay a big monster in the middle of the city while protecting people and avoiding collateral damage.
- **Use challenge as the goal for the Antagonist**. Then the player's goal is to prevent the villain from succeeding, putting the players on the opposite side of the issue. Some challenges can be used right away ("Obtain a McGuffin" is a valid challenge for both villains and players, others can be reversed ("Rescue a person" > "Kidnap a person", "Protect the Castle" > "Invade the Castle").

Why it works:
- **Stories are fundamentally about problem solving**. Roleplaying is fundamentally about problem solving. **This is the fundamental "game loop" of RPGs** - GM puts a problem in front of the players, and they find creative ways to solve it, that's what gives them fun stuff to do and feels satisfying to accomplish. 
- **Adventure Ideas are fundamentally problems**. They create an exciting, challenging, important goal for the players to accomplish.
- Big problems are broken down into small challenges. But fundamentally, the big climactic adventure/campaign goals and the small challenges players encounter on their way **are the same thing**. Every scene the characters solve a small problem, and it drives them towards solving the big problem. **That's what plot points are** - players solving or failing to solve a problem, which moves them closer to or farther away from the goal. Which feels exciting/valuable/dramatic. 
- Conflict, obstacles, social/exploration/combat encounters are fundamentally just **sources of problems**. There probably are other sources that can generate problems.
- It's all just nested challenges: Campaign Problem > Adventure Problem > Scene Problem. And any challenge can be used on any of these levels. 
- Therefore, **the list above is a list of adventure ideas and plot points at the same time**. Make any challenge very important/difficult/exciting to accomplish - and it becomes an idea for the adventure or a campaign. Make any adventure idea relatively small and simple - and it becomes a scene challenge (encounter). Put a number of smaller challenges in front of the players - and you've got your basic story structure (a list of encounters, the gameplay). Because goals and challenges are fundamentally the same, just the nested problems, they can be combined in any order to create any number of unique adventures.
-  Also, it means that you can take big story ideas from movies, TV episodes, published modules, and use them as ideas for  small encounters. Shawshank Redemption, Alien, Jaws, Incredibles - they can be big campaign ideas, small adventure ideas, or just a thing characters do in a scene (escape from the prison, hide from a monster, defeat a big golem).
- Game mechanics are also challenges. If there's an RPG system that gets players to do something awesome (GM moves in Dungeon World, Favors/Debts and Social Status mechanics from the Undying, Weak Moves from Dream Askew) - you can use those as challenges too.
- Even a single challenge can create an unlimited number of unique stories - you just change the concrete details. McGuffins, NPCs, locations, etc.
