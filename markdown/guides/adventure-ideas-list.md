# A Big list of Adventure Ideas (Player's Goals and Villain's Plans), a list of ways to generate dozens of unique adventure ideas based on the same goal, and some thoughts on Player-driven vs Villain-driven adventures.

Hi! My post about the [Big List of Challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/hmso63/a_big_list_of_challenges/) really took off, and this is a followup - I have analyzed the challenges I've been researching, and compiled the list of challenges that will work well as the main goal for the adventure. I have also made a list of ways to generate dozens of unique adventure ideas based on the same goal. 

And I've had an epiphany about Player-driven vs Villain-driven adventures that I think you will find interesting. The lists of goals and ways to generate unique ideas are at the end of this post, but do read my theory first, it will explain how this works, how it simplifies adventure creation, and leads to more ideas.

# Player-driven vs Villain-driven adventures
There are two types of story ideas:

1. Players want something and struggle against the challenges to get it. 
2. Villain wants something, and players are trying to disrupt/ruin his evil plan.

Both types have merits. In the first type players are the driving force of the adventure, actively leading the story, overcoming relatively passive obstacles. In the second, players are reacting to the villain, trying to disrupt his plans as he pursues his goals, making  the adventure more active and interactive. You can also combine the two - antagonist can actively try to commit the crimes and players can be actively trying to catch him (or vice versa).

To create an adventure of the first type, you come up with a goal for the players, then put obstacles on their path. For the second, you come up with a villain's goal/plan, figure out ways for players to learn about it and disrupt it,  figure out how the villain will react and what resources he has to fight back and get his plan back on track.

They are two sides of the same coin. Creating an opposition for the players gives the villain a goal. Creating a plan for the villain gives players the opposite goal to pursue. So many adventure ideas "mirror" each other, can be played from either side: Players can aim to obtain a McGuffin, or prevent the Antagonist from getting it, investigate the crime or try to commit the crime and avoid getting caught, try to complete a ritual or prevent a villain from completing it. Rescue/Kidnap, Protect/Kill, Guard/Steal, Invade/Defend, Complete/Prevent ritual, Chase/Escape.

 Which side players/villain are on depends on the motivation. Players want to complete the good ritual or prevent an evil one, try to prevent evil crimes and commit the noble ones, kill the bad guys and protect the good guys. 

Understanding this stuff makes it easier to come up with goals for the villains and challenges for the players, because they're just the opposite of each other. Figuring out one automatically gives you the other. It also doubles the number of adventure ideas you have - just "reverse" an adventure idea, get players and villains switch sides, and you have a new idea.

The goals can be opposite (perform a task - prevent them from performing it), or they can be the same - both sides want to obtain the McGuffin, but theres only one, so they compete.

So what I want is to compile a list of such goals:

- They  are "symmetrical" - they can be "played from the either side", they work well as a noble objective for the players, or the evil plan for the villains.
- They are "abstract", one goal can generate dozens of unique adventures. There are hundreds of stories about two people pursuing the same object, there are hundreds of stories about people trying to commit crimes and people trying to stop them. One goal gives you many ideas.
- They are easy to build an adventure around, it is obvious how you could create a fun game/story based on them. They have high stakes, create interesting conflict, and create clear and obvious objectives for players/villains to pursue.

# List of the goals

**Symmetrical goals** (goals that apply to both Heroes and Villains, Players and Antagonists):

- Obtain McGuffin/Information (Players and antagonist compete for the same item, players are trying to prevent antagonist from getting an item. Obtain a treasure map and be the first to the pirate treasure. Prevent a villain from getting a powerful dark artifact. Get back your stolen belongings. Get the heart of Davy Jones.)
- Win a competition / prevent the other side from winning. (Win the race around the world. Win a mock-war between adventuring parties. Win a quidditch game. Deliver a valuable intel to the central command the enemy strikes).
- Seize power (Evil Vizier wants to replace the king and players need to prevent that. Evil King is in charge and players need to overthrow him. The King has died and both sides want to be the next King.)
- Kill/Protect Person/Creature (Kill the villain/hero, avoid getting killed. Kill a vampire/werewolf/basilisk. Kill people to drink their blood or to satisfy violent urges. Unleash a giant monster onto the city. Save the endangered creature from the hunter. Kill all the baddies in the area. Stop a serial killer.).
- Destroy/Protect Target (Item/Castle/Information). Destroy a  doomsday device, unleash a natural disaster onto the city, help people survive a natural disaster, destroy a piece of blackmail, destroy the enemy's base.
- Guard/Steal (robbery, stealthy heist, abduction).
- Invade/Defend city, castle, ship. Compete for control of the territory. (Plan for an attack on the evil citadel. Prepare the city to repel the enemies/monsters. Your town/building/ship has been captured and overtaken by enemies, survive under siege, and liberate it. You have conquered a kingdom, defeat the remaining groups running guerrilla warfare against you.)
- Escort/Intercept (deliver a prisoner to jail or liberate a prisoner en route to prison. transport the treasure or rob a caravan with the treasure)
- Rescue/Kidnap (abduct a person for ransom or sacrificial ritual, rescue hostages, save the princess, break someone out of jail).
- Chase/Escape (Capture the criminal. Escape the pursuit of the law. Help a wrongly convicted to escape. Set up an ambush or escape an ambush. Pursue a person in a car chase or get away from pursuers. Capture a zombie to prove they exist. Capture a unique creature for research.).
- Cause/Resolve conflict (broker peace / start a war).
- Investigate a crime / Don't get caught.
- Discover information / hide information (find out someone's dark secret, protect the secret from getting out, expose a corrupt official).
- Find/Hide (find a missing person, hide a person from danger. find the lost location, ensure that a sacred place can't be found).
- Infiltrate and Spy / Find a mole. (Complete a covert ninja mission. Uncover a conspiracy and prevent a convert mission from taking place. Go under cover in the criminal gang. Blend in with the nobles to poison the King).
- Enforce/Resist (enforce the law, resist unjust laws).
- Frame someone for a crime / Clear the name (find evidence to convict someone / prove their innocence)
- Incite rebellion/mutiny or put it down.
- Perform/Sabotage a task (Complete ritual/experiment or prevent an evil ritual, build a weapon or prevent it from being built. Open portal, Resurrect/Summon/Awaken, or prevent that. Perform/prevent a terrorist act.)
- Get through the dangerous location / set up traps to make the location impossible to pass. Enter and leave a guarded builging / secure the building.
- Diplomacy, Influence, and Negotiations. Compete for the lady's heart, compete to convince the King to take a different course of action, bribe/manipulate/intimidate a corrupt official into doing what you want, try to close a business deal or prevent it from being closed.
- Brainwash and manipulate groups of people into doing your bidding / liberate brainwashed people. (free the town from the min control spell, convince enemy soliders to defect to your side, free a person from the influence of a sinister cult).
- Win a war. Lead an army against enemy general, against rival mob boss or a cowboy gang.

**Goals that apply only to Players**:

- Explore a dangerous location. Survive/avoid environmental dangers (think of the place itself as the “villain”, it is a monster without HP that "wants" to hurt players or drain their resources, and has certain powers to accomplish that. Traps, cave-ins, lava eruptions, rock-slides, avalanche, collapsing buildings, impenetrable mist, wild animals, dangerous/poisonous flora, falling into a pit, getting lost, etc). Overcome environmental obstacles (a river on your way, a closed gate, climbing a mountain, a swamp, quick sand, slipping hazard above the abyss, thin ice, wild magic area. Retrieve an item from the bottom of the lake.).
- Solve a Mystery. Solve a murder or a theft. Understand who is behind a mysterious plot. Understand what happened in the abandoned/deserted city.
- Survive wilderness or a hazardous environment and find a way back home. Get stranded in the desert, an island, an alien land, becalmed or in a storm.
- Help people survive a natural disaster (storm, earthquake, flood, meteor).
- Scavenger hunt. Collect several items from scattered locations. Potion ingredients for a witch, parts of an engine that were scattered during crash landing.
- Train a novice, keep a noble person safe while they go on adventure.
- Act as an experimental subject for a crazy scientist/wizard (for dangerous potions).
- Defeat a horde or a swarm, clear out an infestation. Rats in the basement, wolves in the forest, Zombies, Aliens. Could be impossible to kill them one by one, and must be done with a ritual, destroying the mothership, smashing the necromancer's amulet, lifting an ancient curse, placating the restless spirits, activating the ancient defense mechanisms. 


**Goals that apply only to Villains**:

- Kill/Hurt people (to satisfy urges or as a biological necessity, drink blood for a vampire, rampage as a werewolf.)
- Rule/Destroy the world.
- Sow chaos.

# Creating multiple unique adventures from the same goal
Here are some ways to create dozens of adventure ideas based on the same goal:

- Switch players/antagonist sides (players try to get away with a crime instead of investigating it).
- Reverse the goal (Smuggle/Plant an item instead of stealing it, close the portal instead of opening it, banish the creature instead of summoning it).
- Use a different target - person, creature, item, information, location/base (destroy an item instead of killing a person, abduct a person instead of stealing the treasure, protect a secret instead of the location, chase a lost pet instead of the criminal, chase an object being passed around through different people). 
- Change "do it for yourself" to "help other people" (don't get murdered - prevent a murder, steal an item - create a distraction while someone else steals it, get away with the crime - help someone else to get away with the crime).
- Add restrictions - make it stealthy (commit a heist instead of robbery) , avoid violence (capture a person alive instead of killing them), achieve the goal by social means (ruin the person's reputation instead of killing them), do it before the rivals do it first.
- Combine multiple goals (sabotage a ritual to rescue a person, infiltrate a group to steal an item, deliver an item while on the run from the law, solve a mystery to be able to find a lost person).
- Add different subgoals, put different challenges/obstacles in the way (get throuh the dangerous location instead of an elaborate security system, obtain informatiom about the villain's weakness instead of the only weapon that can kill them, convince a witness to talk instead of following the trail of footsteps. The object is difficult to deliver because it's being hunted by bandits, or because the terrain is dangerous and inhospitable, or because it's large and fragile, or because it's a criminal trying to escape, or because it's cattle you need to keep alive, or because it's a bratty princess who doesn't want to go to school). See the [Big List of Challenges](https://playmirage.io/challenges) for more ideas.
- Use different concrete details - High Concept Premise, Settings, NPCs, McGuffins, etc. (steal an item from a dream instead of casino, escort a dragon instead of a prisoner, escape from jurrasic park instead of the prison, fight a self righteous paladin instead of a gang leader).
- Use different motivations (kill a person out of revenge instead of for money, resurrect your loved one instead of summoning a demon, compete for the heart of the lady instead of the treasure).
