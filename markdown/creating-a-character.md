## Creating your Character

To create your character you will need a character sheet and a character description. Character sheet will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, and inventory. Character description will contain information on your character’s appearance, personality, goals, and backstory - everything you need for roleplaying.

Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character by filling in an empty character sheet.

Next, come up with your character concept and fill in your character description. Even the novice players are encouraged to come up with their own character ideas, but if you’re really stuck or just can’t wait to start playing - you can use one of the premade character descriptions.
