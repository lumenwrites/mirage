### Campaign Structure
Individual quests will work well for one-shot games, played in one or few sessions. A longer campaign is a series of quests, think of them as episodes of a TV show. Chain the three (or more) quests together, to reflect the different stages of a single epic adventure, each one moving the players closer to achieving their overarching goal.

“Find the map to the magic sword” > “Retrieve the sword” > “Use it to slay the Dragon”

### Quest Structure
Each quest consists of several challenges, and each challenge is made out of several scenes that the players will play out in their effort to achieve their goal.

- **Adventure Hook**  
Decide on the first scene that draws the characters into action, the way they encounter the problem and realize that it needs to be solved. It should also give them the first set of tasks to accomplish.
- **Escalating Challenges**  
Pick 3 (or more) challenges the characters need to overcome in order to achieve their goal. 3 milestones to take them from where  they are to where they want to be. A rollercoaster of victories and setbacks.
- **Climax**  
The last challenge is the biggest one, the  most important, and the most dangerous. It will ultimately determine whether they succeed or fail. Either way, the outcome will significantly change their lives or the world.
- **Resolution**  
Tie up the loose plot threads, show how the world has changed, the consequences of their actions. Give out the rewards.

### Scene Structure
A scene needs 3 elements:
- **Setting**  
Describe the location. Start with the most obvious and urgent things that people would notice upon entering a scene.  
Add details that engage all of the players' senses, set the mood of the scene.  
Add opportunities for players to creatively use their abilities and spells (like a chandelier that can be dropped on the enemies, or chained wolves that can be set loose). Add environmental challenges (traps, puzzles, a firepit or an abyss in their way).

- **Characters**  
Prepare some talking points for the dialogue - what information does the NPC need to convey?  
What will the NPCs do to help players out or to set them back? 

- **Action and Conflict (Desire+Obstacle)**  
Understand what the players want, and what stands in their way. What complication will arise? What difficult decision do they need to make?  
Consider raising the stakes. Things go from good, to bad, to worst, to resolved.

- **Change of Value**
How does this scene move the story forward?
